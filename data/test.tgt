And he laughed again .
" It will be as if , in place of the stars , I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh ... "
And he laughed again .
Then he quickly became serious : " Tonight - - you know ... do not come , " said the little prince .
" I shall not leave you , "
I said .
" I shall look as if I were suffering .
I shall look a little as if I were dying .
It is like that .
Do not come to see that .
It is not worth the trouble ... "
" I shall not leave you . "
But he was worried .
" I tell you - - it is also because of the snake .
He must not bite you .
Snakes - - they are malicious creatures .
This one might bite you just for fun ... "
" I shall not leave you . "
But a thought came to reassure him : " It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite . "
That night I did not see him set out on his way .
He got away from me without making a sound .
When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step .
He said to me merely : " Ah !
You are there ... "
And he took me by the hand .
But he was still worrying .
" It was wrong of you to come .
You will suffer .
I shall look as if I were dead ; and that will not be true ... "
I said nothing .
" You understand ... it is too far .
I can not carry this body with me .
It is too heavy . "
I said nothing .
" But it will be like an old abandoned shell .
There is nothing sad about old shells ... "
I said nothing .
He was a little discouraged .
But he made one more effort : " You know , it will be very nice .
I , too , shall look at the stars .
All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley .
All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink ... "
I said nothing .
" That will be so amusing !
You will have five hundred million little bells , and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water ... "
And he too said nothing more , because he was crying ...
" Here it is .
Let me go on by myself . "
And he sat down , because he was afraid .
Then he said , again : " You know - - my flower ...
I am responsible for her .
And she is so weak !
She is so naïve !
She has four thorns , of no use at all , to protect herself against all the world ... "
I too sat down , because I was not able to stand up any longer .
" There now - - that is all ... "
He still hesitated a little ; then he got up .
He took one step .
I could not move .
There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle .
He remained motionless for an instant .
He did not cry out .
He fell as gently as a tree falls .
There was not even any sound , because of the sand .
Chapter 27 .
And now six years have already gone by ...
I have never yet told this story .
The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive .
I was sad , but I told them : " I am tired . "
Now my sorrow is comforted a little .
That is to say - - not entirely .
But I know that he did go back to his planet , because I did not find his body at daybreak .
It was not such a heavy body ... and at night I love to listen to the stars .
It is like five hundred million little bells ...
But there is one extraordinary thing ... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince , I forgot to add the leather strap to it .
He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep .
So now I keep wondering : what is happening on his planet ?
Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower ...
At one time I say to myself : " Surely not !
The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night , and he watches over his sheep very carefully ... "
Then I am happy .
And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars .
But at another time I say to myself : " At some moment or other one is absent - minded , and that is enough !
On some one evening he forgot the glass globe , or the sheep got out , without making any noise , in the night ... "
And then the little bells are changed to tears ...
Here , then , is a great mystery .
For you who also love the little prince , and for me , nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere , we do not know where , a sheep that we never saw has - - yes or no ? -- eaten a rose ...
Look up at the sky .
Ask yourselves : is it yes or no ?
Has the sheep eaten the flower ?
And you will see how everything changes ...
And no grown - up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance !
This is , to me , the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world .
It is the same as that on the preceding page , but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory .
It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth , and disappeared .
Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert .
And , if you should come upon this spot , please do not hurry on .
Wait for a time , exactly under the star .
Then , if a little man appears who laughs , who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions , you will know who he is .
If this should happen , please comfort me .
