When I came back from my work , the next evening , I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall , with his feet dangling .
And I heard him say : " Then you do n't remember .
This is not the exact spot . "
Another voice must have answered him , for he replied to it : " Yes , yes !
It is the right day , but this is not the place . "
I continued my walk toward the wall .
At no time did I see or hear anyone .
The little prince , however , replied once again : " -- Exactly .
You will see where my track begins , in the sand .
You have nothing to do but wait for me there .
I shall be there tonight . "
I was only twenty metres from the wall , and I still saw nothing .
After a silence the little prince spoke again : " You have good poison ?
You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long ? "
I stopped in my tracks , my heart torn asunder ; but still I did not understand .
" Now go away , " said the little prince .
" I want to get down from the wall . "
I dropped my eyes , then , to the foot of the wall - - and I leaped into the air .
There before me , facing the little prince , was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end .
Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back .
But , at the noise I made , the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain , and , in no apparent hurry , disappeared , with a light metallic sound , among the stones .
I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms ; his face was white as snow .
" What does this mean ? "
I demanded .
" Why are you talking with snakes ? "
I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore .
I had moistened his temples , and had given him some water to drink .
And now I did not dare ask him any more questions .
He looked at me very gravely , and put his arms around my neck .
I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird , shot with someone 's rifle ...
" I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine , " he said .
" Now you can go back home - - "
" How do you know about that ? "
I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful , beyond anything that I had dared to hope .
He made no answer to my question , but he added : " I , too , am going back home today ... "
Then , sadly - - " It is much farther ... it is much more difficult ... "
I realised clearly that something extraordinary was happening .
I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child ; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him ...
His look was very serious , like some one lost far away .
" I have your sheep .
And I have the sheep 's box .
And I have the muzzle ... "
And he gave me a sad smile .
I waited a long time .
I could see that he was reviving little by little .
" Dear little man , "
I said to him , " you are afraid ... "
He was afraid , there was no doubt about that .
But he laughed lightly .
" I shall be much more afraid this evening ... "
Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable .
And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more .
For me , it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert .
" Little man , "
I said , " I want to hear you laugh again . "
But he said to me : " Tonight , it will be a year ... my star , then , can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth , a year ago ... "
" Little man , "
I said , " tell me that it is only a bad dream - - this affair of the snake , and the meeting - place , and the star ... "
But he did not answer my plea .
He said to me , instead : " The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen ... "
" Yes , I know ... "
" It is just as it is with the flower .
If you love a flower that lives on a star , it is sweet to look at the sky at night .
All the stars are a - bloom with flowers ... "
" Yes , I know ... "
" It is just as it is with the water .
Because of the pulley , and the rope , what you gave me to drink was like music .
You remember - - how good it was . "
" Yes , I know ... "
" And at night you will look up at the stars .
Where I live everything is so small that I can not show you where my star is to be found .
It is better , like that .
My star will just be one of the stars , for you .
And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens ... they will all be your friends .
And , besides , I am going to make you a present ... "
He laughed again .
" Ah , little prince , dear little prince !
I love to hear that laughter ! "
" That is my present .
Just that .
It will be as it was when we drank the water ... "
" What are you trying to say ? "
" All men have the stars , " he answered , " but they are not the same things for different people .
For some , who are travelers , the stars are guides .
For others they are no more than little lights in the sky .
For others , who are scholars , they are problems .
For my businessman they were wealth .
But all these stars are silent .
You - - you alone - - will have the stars as no one else has them - - "
" What are you trying to say ? "
" In one of the stars I shall be living .
In one of them I shall be laughing .
And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing , when you look at the sky at night ... you - - only you - - will have stars that can laugh ! "
And he laughed again .
" And when your sorrow is comforted ( time soothes all sorrows ) you will be content that you have known me .
You will always be my friend .
You will want to laugh with me .
And you will sometimes open your window , so , for that pleasure ... and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky !
Then you will say to them , ' Yes , the stars always make me laugh ! ' And they will think you are crazy .
It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you ... "
